# LAYGO - LAYout with Gridded Objects 

An add-on to [BAG2](https://bwrcrepo.eecs.berkeley.edu/erichang/bag2) framework for layout generation.
With LAYGO, primitive layout parameters are abstracted as templates and grids such that the actual layout job can be done without dealing with complex design rules.
Layout process is abstracted and scripted in python, and with the help of BAG API, LAYGO provides higher productivity and process portability over conventional custom IC design flows.
